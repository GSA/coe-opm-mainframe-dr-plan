## Background

The mission of the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA), [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (TTS), [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE) is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization across government to improve the public experience, improve outcomes, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. The CoEs accomplish this by centralizing top Government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset to collaborate across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides agency partners with a shared service solution for professional services.

The U.S. [Office of Personnel Management](https://www.opm.gov/) (OPM) uses mainframe hardware to run two mission-critical workloads (Background Investigation and Retirement Service applications), and that mainframe hardware requires modernization. This hardware presents multiple challenges from maintenance, information security, and availability perspectives. While modernization is the final goal, OPM recognizes that stabilizing the current mainframe infrastructure is an initial step to implementing those modernization plans and OPM cannot neglect legacy infrastructure needs in the process. The CoE has been tasked to assist with the acquisition of modern mainframe hardware, and to support local OPM resources as they plan, migrate, and utilize this new hardware to setup a more secure and redundant solution.

CoE has issued a Request for Information (RFI) and a Draft Request for Quote (RFQ), all of which can be found on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/GSA/coe-opm-mainframe-dr-plan/. The RFI will be open for comment until noon EDT on Monday, July 15, 2019. 

Please note this is a Draft RFQ and no award will be issued as a result of this market research-related function. Feedback must be submitted through the Google Form associated with the RFI, other forms of feedback submitted through email or other forms of communication will not be accepted.

## Purpose

The existing hardware (IBM Z12 mainframes) are nearing their end of life. They do not  support several modern information security standards and are expensive to maintain. OPM has decided to proceed by upgrading their existing hardware to allow for a proper modernization process to take place while maintaining quality of service for the multiple workloads they support.

The two primary workloads are:

1. Background investigation. The National Background Investigations Bureau (NBIB)'s Federal Investigations Processing Center (FIPC) receives requests for investigation, processes the requests through an automated system, and serves as an entrance point for case-related and operational questions. Agencies may contact FIPC for assistance ordering investigations, obtaining access to NBIB's automated systems, or for information about NBIB investigative policies and procedures.
2. Retirement Service applications. The retirement services (RS) mainframe systems includes multiple systems that support the retirement and human resources efforts of OPM and its partners. This mainframe serves as the system of record for many retirement services systems across the federal government. It also serves as the interface to industry actors, such as insurance companies, financial institutions, payroll vendors, etc., and all federal agencies.

CoE and OPM are seeking to obtain mainframe hardware, and the services associated with delivery and bringing them to “code 20” for each of their two data centers. The new mainframes will be delivered to two geographically-remote and OPM-owned data centers, located in Macon, GA and Boyers, PA or other federal government hosting facility within the continental United States. They will be set up in a redundant failover setup for disaster recovery (D/R) by internal OPM resources.
